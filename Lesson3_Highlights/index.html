            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> A version control system, also known as a VCS, has many benefits, but its biggest benefit would have to be that it resolves many file sharing conflicts. The VCS makes note of any changes made such as when changes were made to a code, who changed it, what was changed, and what was merged. Not only that but no file is overwritten, people can work on the same file at the same time, you could revert back to an old version of a project or file, the latest files are kept in one place, and VCS will backup your files so you don't lose what you've worked on. VCSs are extremely useful with large coding projects and when working in a team where many hands might touch the same code. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">GIT Basics</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> GIT is one of the main version control systems that are used. Git was invented in 2005 which a goal of creating a system that was simple, fast, had a strong support for non-linear development, was fully distributed, and was able to handle like the Linux kernel efficiently (which just means speed and data size). Git thinks of files more conceptually than other systems. For example if a file has not been changed, it will not store that file again. It see's files as a snapshot and as long as the snapshot stays in tact then it will not attempt to use more energy to store whats already there.  </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git: The 3 States</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Further analyzing Git, I learned that Git had 3 main states which are: committed, modified, and staged. When your data is stored safely in your database that means that it is committed. Modified means exactly what you think it does, it means the file has been changed BUT that it (meaning the file) has not been committed. Lastly, staged means that you have allocated a specific modified version to get committed in your next snapshot of files. This leas us to the Working directory, staging area, and Git directory (or aka the repository). Git stores the metadata and object database of any project in the Git directory. The working directory is a single checkout a certain project and the staging area is where you store information that will go onto your next commit. Understanding this cycle is very important when understanding Git. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Local</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">If you were in a place with no internet, you could count on Git to do your work because Git only needs local files and resources to operate. This also has the added benefit of being incredibly fast because you have the entire history of the project on your local disk making all operations basically instantaneous. This means, there is very few limitations if you must work offline and/or are off VPN. This is especially beneficial when working on an important project and have to work on the go, such as in planes or trains. This way working is more efficient and convenient.

                <span class="text-muted">Once it is out there, it is out there</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Unlike in other VCSs, in git almost all commands only add data. Once a snapshot is committed to git, it is very hard to lose. In git, it is very difficult to get anything that will erase all the work that has been saved. Once it is in the system, it will not be lost. Of course, it is still possible to lose or mess up changes made that have not been committed, but once committed it is there. This is a good thing because it means that you have more of a wiggle room to experiment without the fear of losing previous work. </p>
